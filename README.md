# A VERY SHORT NOTE ON THE (RATIONAL) GRADEDHORI MAP

The graded Hori map has been recently introduced by Han-Mathai in the context of T-duality as aZ-graded transform whose homoge-neous components are the Hori-Fourier transforms in twisted cohomologyassociated with integral multiples of a basic pair of T-dual closed 3-forms.We show how in the rational homotopy theory approximation of T-duality,such a map is naturally realised as a pull-iso-push transform, where theisomorphism part corresponds to the canonical equivalence between theleft and the right gerbes associated with a T-duality configuration.
