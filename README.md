# A very short note on the (rational) graded Hori map

The graded Hori map has been recently introduced by Han-Mathai in the context of T-duality as a Z-graded transform whose homogeneous components are the Hori-Fourier transforms in twisted cohomology associated with integral multiples of a basic pair of T-dual closed 3-forms. 
We show how in the rational homotopy theory approximation of T-duality, such a map is naturally realised as a pull-iso-push transform, where the isomorphism part corresponds to the canonical equivalence between the left and the right gerbes associated with a T-duality configuration.
